            <h2>Pricing for Compositions</h2>
            <p>My rates are straightforward and based on the length of the music. Here’s how it breaks down:</p>

            <div class="pricing">
                <h3>Composition Rates</h3>
                <p><strong>$1,000 per minute</strong></p>
                <p>This includes the composition, orchestration, and full score preparation. Revisions can be discussed depending on the complexity and amount of work involved.</p>
                
                <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>5-minute composition: $5,000</li>
                    <li>10-minute composition: $10,000</li>
                    <li>45-minute composition: $45,000</li>
                    <li>60-minute composition: $60,000</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="pricing">
                <h3>Printing and Shipping (for Scores & Parts)</h3>
                <p>Printed scores and parts are available through a print-to-order service. Below are the typical costs for printed versions:</p>

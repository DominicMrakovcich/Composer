      <h2>About</h2>
      <section>
        <p>Dominic Mrakovcich is a composer and sound designer based in Marquette, Michigan, whose musical journey spans diverse cultural influences and an ever-evolving exploration of sound. Drawing from both Brazilian and Croatian heritage, Dominic’s artistry has been deeply shaped by a blend of traditions, including an extensive exploration of Croatian folk songs that he studied during his Master’s program. This multi-faceted background fuels his passion for sound and music, blending historical perspectives with modern techniques in every project.</p>

        <p>His musical journey began in middle school when he first encountered Howard Shore’s legendary score for *The Lord of the Rings*. This pivotal moment ignited his love for film scoring and composition, leading him to pursue a career where the emotional power of music could enhance storytelling. Growing up in Bozrah, Connecticut, he was captivated by how sound could transform a narrative, sparking his commitment to composing music that could evoke deep emotions and memories.</p>

        <p>Dominic’s academic path began with a Bachelor’s degree in Percussion Performance from UMass Amherst, where he studied under Ayano Kataoka. Here, he not only honed his technical proficiency but also started to develop a distinct artistic voice, particularly in the realms of vibraphone and marimba. As a member of the Mass Marimba Ensemble and the university’s marching band, Dominic gained invaluable performance experience, while his composition studies under Salvatore Macchia expanded his understanding of modern techniques and compositional frameworks, particularly from the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>

        <p>In 2020, Dominic continued his academic pursuits with a Master’s degree in Music Composition at UMass Amherst under the mentorship of Ed Jacobs. During this period, he gained recognition for his sophisticated serialist compositions, developing a technical mastery of the genre. His compositions were often marked by complex structures and deep intellectual exploration of sound. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on his creative journey. Forced to adapt to a new reality, Dominic shifted his focus from classical serialism to a more ambient, electronic style, diving into synthesizers, Eurorack systems, and the experimental world of cassette and noise-based music. This period of exploration allowed him to break free from traditional methods and embrace the innovative potential of digital sound manipulation.</p>

        <p>During the 2020-2024 period, Dominic became involved in the underground ambient scene, collaborating with the intentionally misspelled band *Hearding Dogs*. This band became known for its unorthodox and immersive approach to sound, combining ambient, noise, and experimental textures. Their works, crafted from a deep well of spontaneous creativity and unconventional techniques, provided a canvas for exploring the tactile nature of sound, exploring the interrelationship between digital manipulation and analog warmth. These experiments in sound became foundational to Dominic’s approach to contemporary composition.</p>

        <p>Beyond his formal studies, Dominic found a platform for creative expression through *Soundtrack Sundays*, a radio show on WCNI, where he explored and shared his deep passion for film scores, both classic and contemporary. This program not only furthered his understanding of sound design but also offered him an outlet to reflect on the ways in which music and sound interact within the medium of film. It was an experience that enriched his knowledge of audio aesthetics and broadened his appreciation for the art of sound storytelling.</p>

        <p>In 2024, Dominic took on the role of Sound & Media Supervisor at Northern Michigan University in Marquette. This professional milestone not only marked a geographical shift but also served as a pivotal moment in his career. This position allowed him to continue refining his sound design skills, experimenting with emerging media technologies while continuing his compositional work. His integration of sound design with media technology is guided by his passion for experimental sound and open-source technologies, striving to bridge the gap between natural and synthetic sonic environments.</p>

        <p>Dominic’s recent portfolio includes notable projects such as *Alice in Wonderland: An Immersive Experience*, a ballet scored for wind ensemble that incorporates immersive electronic soundscapes alongside live orchestration. Premiering in February 2025, this groundbreaking production exemplifies Dominic’s ability to blend traditional musical forms with cutting-edge sound design, creating a multi-sensory experience that challenges the conventional boundaries between acoustic and electronic music. This project has been a defining moment, cementing his place at the forefront of modern composition and immersive sound experiences.</p>

        <p>Dominic is also deeply invested in field recording, audio technology, and sound ecology. His ongoing St. John’s Sound Initiative project reflects his commitment to documenting the natural and urban sonic environments of his community. This project aims to preserve the soundscapes of today for future generations, ensuring that the sounds of our world—both human-made and natural—are recorded and celebrated. Dominic's work in sound ecology exemplifies his dedication to the belief that the sounds of the world should be captured, experienced, and understood in a new way.</p>

        <p>Throughout his career, Dominic’s music has been driven by a constant search for new sonic possibilities. Whether drawing on his Croatian heritage, experimenting with modern techniques, or fusing electronic and acoustic worlds, his work consistently explores new ways of using sound to tell stories. His compositions offer a rich interplay of technical sophistication and emotional depth, reflecting his diverse influences, including Western classical traditions, experimental sound design, and cultural folk music.</p>

        <p>Dominic’s work continues to challenge the boundaries of composition and sound design. By incorporating innovative technologies and drawing from both his cultural background and global musical influences, he is poised to create ever-evolving soundscapes that push the limits of what music and sound can communicate. His career is one of constant exploration, innovation, and dedication to the craft of creating music that not only challenges but also inspires and invites audiences into new worlds of auditory experience.</p>

        <p>Dominic Mrakovcich's musical journey has spanned nearly two decades, from his early composition studies to earning a Master's in Music Composition from East Carolina University. His passion for pushing musical boundaries is palpable in his exploration of blending electronic synthesizers with nature field recordings, often crafting captivating and immersive ambient soundscapes. Beyond his creative pursuits, Dominic has shared his expertise as a music theory and percussion instructor, inspiring students with his dynamic teaching style. As the Radio Disc Jockey of "Soundtrack Sundays," he has connected with the community through curated playlists on WCNI New London, 90.9 FM. Drawing on his technical theater background, Dominic has honed his skills working as a technician for Connecticut College and The Garde Arts Center, while immersing himself in New London's vibrant punk-ambient night scene. Now, as the Sound & Media Supervisor at Northern Michigan University, Dominic is dedicated to spotlighting NMU's talented students nationally, with sponsorships, video productions, and sound design classes in the works.</p>

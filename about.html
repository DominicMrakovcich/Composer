      <h2>About</h2>
      <section>
       <p>Dominic Mrakovcich is a composer whose work bridges classical tradition and modern ambient sound. He has been commissioned for a range of projects, including the original score for Miguel Ramirez’s short film No Care in the World and a full-length ballet adaptation of Alice in Wonderland for Northern Michigan University. His music blends acoustic and electronic elements, often incorporating synthesizers and field recordings into carefully structured forms.

        Dominic earned his Master’s in Music Composition from East Carolina University, where he studied with Ed Jacobs, and holds a Bachelor's from UMass Amherst, where he studied under Salvatore Macchia, Ayano Kataoka, and Thom Hannum. Beyond composition, he has taught music theory and percussion, hosted Soundtrack Sundays on WCNI 90.9 FM, and worked extensively in technical theater with Connecticut College and The Garde Arts Center.
        
        Currently, he serves as Sound & Media Supervisor at Northern Michigan University, where he supports student work through video production, sponsorships, and sound design education.</p> </section>

      <h2>About</h2>
      <section>
        <p>Dominic Mrakovcich is a composer and sound designer based in Marquette, Michigan, whose work blends diverse cultural influences and a deep passion for sound. Drawing from his Brazilian and Croatian heritage, Dominic’s artistry incorporates a rich mix of traditions, including his study of Croatian folk songs during his Master’s program. This blend of historical and modern perspectives shapes his unique approach to music and sound design.</p>

<p>Dominic’s love for composition began in middle school when he encountered Howard Shore’s iconic score for *The Lord of the Rings*. Captivated by how sound could enhance storytelling, he pursued a career in film scoring. He earned a Bachelor’s in Percussion Performance from UMass Amherst, refining his technical skills while developing a distinct artistic voice. He later completed a Master’s in Music Composition, where he became known for his sophisticated serialist compositions.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic shifted Dominic’s creative direction, leading him to explore ambient, electronic music. His involvement with the underground ambient scene and the band *Hearding Dogs* allowed him to experiment with unorthodox sound textures. Additionally, his radio show, *Soundtrack Sundays*, deepened his understanding of sound design.

In 2024, Dominic became Sound & Media Supervisor at Northern Michigan University, continuing to refine his craft. His latest project, *Alice in Wonderland: An Immersive Experience*, showcases his ability to blend traditional and electronic soundscapes. Dominic’s work pushes the boundaries of modern composition, incorporating innovative technologies and cultural influences to create immersive sonic experiences.</p>

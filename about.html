      <h2>About</h2>
      <section>
        <p>Dominic Mrakovcich is a composer and sound designer based in Marquette, Michigan. His musical journey began in middle school, when Howard Shore's iconic score for <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> sparked his passion for composition. Growing up in Bozrah, Connecticut, Dominic immersed himself in music and dedicated himself to composing from the moment he first experienced the power of film scores.</p>

        <p>He graduated from <i>Norwich Free Academy</i> in 2010 and went on to earn a Bachelor’s degree in Percussion Performance from <i>UMass Amherst</i>, where he studied under Ayano Kataoka. During his time at the university, he performed with the marching band and the Mass Marimba Ensemble, while gaining valuable experience in arranging. He graduated in 2014. However, it was his composition studies with <i>Salvatore Macchia</i> that truly shaped his artistic development, guiding him toward a focus on modern composition techniques.</p>

        <p>In 2020, Dominic completed a Master’s degree in Music Composition under the mentorship of <i>Ed Jacobs</i>. His time in graduate school was marked by intense workshops, composition for the New Music Initiative, and the creation of student solo works. During this period, Dominic honed a sophisticated serialist style. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, led to a pivotal shift in his creative approach. Moving away from serialism, he embraced ambient music and electronic composition, incorporating a wide range of synthesizers into his work.</p>

        <p>During this period of transition, Dominic also explored new avenues by working part-time jobs and hosting *Soundtrack Sundays* on <i>WCNI</i>, where he deepened his love for film scores and sound design. In 2024, he took on the role of <i>Sound & Media Supervisor</i> at <i>Northern Michigan University</i>, marking a major turning point in his life. This move brought him to Marquette, Michigan, where he embraced a new chapter filled with both challenges and opportunities.</p>

        <p>One of Dominic’s most celebrated works is <i>Alice in Wonderland: An Immersive Experience</i>, a ballet scored for wind ensemble. The production features a unique combination of live orchestration and electronic ambient soundscapes, enhancing the experience both before and after the show. Premiering in <i>February 2025</i>, this project has been pivotal in establishing his reputation within the field.</p>

        <p>Outside of composition, Dominic is deeply engaged in field recording, audio technology, and sound ecology. He leads projects like the <i>St. John's Sound Initiative</i> and remains passionate about experimental sound, open-source technology, and media archiving—driving his creative endeavors forward.</p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <section>
          <p>Dominic Mrakovcich is a composer and sound designer based in Marquette, Michigan, whose musical journey spans diverse cultural influences and an ever-evolving exploration of sound. With roots in both Brazilian and Croatian heritage, Dominic’s identity and artistry have been shaped by a rich tapestry of traditions, including an extensive exploration of Croatian folk songs, which he delved into during his Master’s studies. His early passion for music was sparked in middle school by Howard Shore’s legendary score for *The Lord of the Rings*, a moment that ignited his love for composition and film scores. Growing up in Bozrah, Connecticut, he was drawn to the power of sound in storytelling and quickly committed himself to composing, fascinated by the emotional depth that music could bring to narrative forms.</p>

  <p>After graduating from Norwich Free Academy in 2010, Dominic pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Percussion Performance at UMass Amherst, studying under Ayano Kataoka. His academic years were marked by both technical proficiency and artistic exploration. He performed with the marching band and the Mass Marimba Ensemble, gaining invaluable experience in arranging and collaborating in performance settings. It was here that he began to develop a distinctive voice in percussion, especially focusing on vibraphone and marimba. However, it was his composition studies with Salvatore Macchia that truly transformed his approach to music, instilling in him a deep appreciation for modern composition techniques, particularly those of the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>

  <p>In 2020, Dominic continued his academic pursuits by completing a Master’s degree in Music Composition at UMass Amherst under the mentorship of Ed Jacobs. His time in graduate school was marked by rigorous workshops, intensive composition for the New Music Initiative, and the creation of student solo works. During this period, Dominic became known for his sophisticated serialist style, reflecting his technical mastery and intellectual approach to composition. However, the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a dramatic shift in his creative trajectory. As the world changed, so did his music—Dominic moved away from serialism and began to explore the world of ambient and electronic composition. The pandemic served as both a challenge and an opportunity, and he fully embraced it by diving deep into synthesizers, Eurorack systems, and the raw, experimental textures of cassette and noise-based music. This marked the beginning of his immersion in the world of electronic sound design, and it significantly reshaped his compositional approach.</p>

  <p>During this period of transformation, Dominic also explored new creative avenues outside of his formal education. He hosted *Soundtrack Sundays* on WCNI, a radio program that allowed him to indulge his passion for film scores, both contemporary and classic, further deepening his understanding of sound design. These experiences exposed him to a wealth of new sounds, techniques, and perspectives, and provided a platform for him to reflect on the intersections of film, music, and technology.</p>

  <p>In 2024, Dominic’s career took another pivotal step when he became the Sound & Media Supervisor at Northern Michigan University. This move to Marquette not only marked a geographical shift but also a professional milestone, as it placed him at the crossroads of education, sound design, and technology. The role opened new doors, allowing him to further develop his sound design expertise while also continuing his creative practice as a composer. His ongoing work with sound and media technology is informed by his dedication to experimental sound, open-source technology, and the intersection of natural and synthetic sonic environments.</p>

  <p>Dominic’s portfolio of work reflects his growing interest in blending different artistic mediums and incorporating new technologies into traditional forms. One of his most notable projects is *Alice in Wonderland: An Immersive Experience*, a ballet scored for wind ensemble. Premiering in February 2025, this production blends live orchestration with immersive electronic soundscapes, creating a multi-sensory experience that challenges traditional boundaries between acoustic and electronic music. The project has been a defining moment in his career, showcasing his ability to fuse different sonic worlds and elevate the narrative experience through sound.</p>

  <p>Outside of his formal compositions, Dominic’s work extends into field recording, audio technology, and sound ecology. He leads initiatives like the St. John’s Sound Initiative, an ongoing project dedicated to exploring the sonic environments of his local community and preserving audio documentation of natural and urban spaces. His work in sound ecology reflects his belief in the importance of capturing the world around us, ensuring that future generations can hear and experience the sounds of today’s world. In all of his projects, Dominic seeks to push boundaries—whether it’s through experimental sound design, interactive media, or his continued advocacy for open-source technology in creative spaces.</p>

  <p>Dominic’s music is a fusion of technical expertise and emotional depth, rooted in his exploration of both Western and non-Western musical traditions. His Croatian heritage, in particular, has remained a vital source of inspiration, and his engagement with Croatian folk songs during his master’s studies continues to inform his work. His compositions are rich with layers of cultural history, but they are also deeply modern, reflecting his ongoing commitment to exploring new soundscapes, techniques, and technologies. With each project, Dominic pushes the limits of what sound can express, whether through orchestral arrangements, immersive experiences, or the raw power of electronic noise.</p>

  <p>In sum, Dominic Mrakovcich’s work stands at the intersection of tradition and innovation, fusing the heritage of his ancestry with his bold exploration of contemporary sound. His journey from the world of classical percussion to the frontier of experimental sound design reflects his unyielding drive to engage with music as both an art form and a tool for innovation. As his career continues to unfold, Dominic remains committed to creating music that challenges, excites, and invites listeners into new worlds of sonic possibility.</p>

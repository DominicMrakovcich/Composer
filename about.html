      <h2>About</h2>
      <section>
        <p>Dominic Mrakovcich is a composer and sound designer based in Marquette, Michigan. His journey into music began in middle school, when Howard Shore’s epic score for <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> ignited his passion for composition. Growing up in Bozrah, Connecticut, he immersed himself in music, dedicating himself to composition from the moment he first encountered film scores.</p>

        <p>Dominic graduated from <i>Norwich Free Academy</i> in 2010 before pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Percussion Performance at <i>UMass Amherst</i>, where he studied under Ayano Kataoka and performed in the university’s marching band and Mass Marimba Ensemble while gaining experience in arranging. He graduated in 2014. However, it was his studies in composition under <i>Salvatore Macchia</i> that had the most profound impact on his artistic approach, solidifying his focus on modern composition techniques.</p>

        <p>In 2020, Dominic completed a Master’s degree in Music Composition, studying under <i>Ed Jacobs</i>. During this time, he engaged in rigorous workshops, composing for the New Music Initiative and student solo repertoire, refining a complex, serialist style. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 marked a period of significant change for many artists, including Dominic, who transitioned away from his serial composition approach to embrace ambient music and electronic composition, incorporating a vast array of synthesizers into his work.</p>

        <p>During this transitional phase, Dominic took on various part-time jobs and became a radio DJ, hosting *Soundtrack Sundays* on <i>WCNI</i>, where he deepened his appreciation for film scores and sound design. In 2024, he secured a position as <i>Sound & Media Supervisor</i> at <i>Northern Michigan University</i>, prompting him to leave Connecticut entirely for a fresh start in Marquette, a move he welcomed as both a challenge and an opportunity.</p>

        <p>One of his most widely recognized works is <i>Alice in Wonderland: An Immersive Experience</i>, a ballet scored for wind ensemble, featuring both live orchestration and electronic ambient soundscapes for pre- and post-show settings. This project premiered in <i>February 2025</i> and has significantly contributed to his reputation in the field.</p>

        <p>Beyond composition, Dominic is also involved in field recording, audio technology, and sound ecology, leading projects such as the <i>St. John's Sound Initiative</i>. His passion for experimental sound, open-source technology, and media archiving drives his creative work.</p>
